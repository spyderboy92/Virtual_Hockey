The aim of this project is to virtualise the air hockey game using a projector and infrared pointers.
We are using openCV2 and working on PYTHON 2.7.
Using Perspective image transformation, we would create a new virtual arena and then detect the movement by infrared LEDs, and the data would be used as a mouse pointer in the game running on computer.
